 it was time for a haircut Lenny didn't even have to look in the mirror even though he was going bald he knew that he needed to cut his hair every two weeks he had a ton of hair on the top of his head his hair was thinning at the crown he still had plenty of hair on the sides and back it was what they call Salt and Pepper a mixture of gray hair and dark brown hair  it was only a few years he figured until the salt and pepper became just salt he never let his hair grow for more than 2 weeks the longer it got the worse it looked he thought he spread a newspaper over the bathroom sink so that no hair went down the drain he plugged in the Clippers and started cutting his hair he started at the back of head went to the sides and finished on the top every minute or so he had to clean the hair out of the blades with an old toothbrush  finished he picked up a hand mirror to check out the back of his head everything looked okay he carried the newspaper back out to the kitchen and Chuck the hair clippings into the trash can then he took a shower
