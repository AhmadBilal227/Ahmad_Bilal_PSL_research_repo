One hot day, a thirsty crow flew all over the fields looking for water. 
He did not find any water for a long time. 
He felt very weak, almost lost all hope.
Suddenly, he saw a water jug below the tree. 
He flew straight down to see if there was any water inside. 
Yes, he could see some water inside the jug.
The crow tried to push his head into the jug.
Sadly, he found that the neck of the jug was too narrow. 
He tried to push the jug so that water flows out, but the jug was too heavy. 
The crow thought for a while. 
When he looked around, he saw some pebbles.
Suddenly, He had a good idea. 
He picked up the pebbles, one by one, and dropped them into the jug. 
When pebbles filled the jug, 
the water level rose up. 
The crow could drink the water now. 
His plan had worked.
