One day, a hungry fox was wandering in the forest. 
She was searching for food. 
Suddenly, she saw a crow sitting in a tree. 
It was holding a piece of meat in its beak. 
The big piece of meat attracted the hungry fox.
She sat down under the tree and thought about some clever trick to get the meat. 
Suddenly, a clever idea came to her mind. 
She began to praise the crow. 
She said that crows are very lovely birds and they have beautiful voice. 
The crow got trapped in her trick. 
He looked down to the fox. 
Fox requested him to sing her a song. 
When the crow opened his beak to sing, the piece of meat fell down. 
The fox took the meat and ran away. 
She had made a fool of the crow.
